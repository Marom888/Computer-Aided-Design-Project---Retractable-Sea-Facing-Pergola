This project presents the design of a retractable shading pergola intended for use in a seaside environment.
The model was created using CREO Parametric as part of the Computer-Aided Design (CAD) course at the Technion.

The project includes:

Full 3D modeling of all pergola components

A retractable opening–closing mechanism

Engineering drawings generated directly from the model

Design considerations for outdoor and coastal conditions

This work demonstrates proficiency in CAD modeling, mechanical design, and engineering documentation using CREO.
